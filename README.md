# Skylee Task Manager

Skylee Task Manager (STM) is a **cross-platform command-line app for managing tasks**. If you can type fast, STM can get your task management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.
1. Download the latest `ip.jar` from [here](https://github.com/skylee03/ip/releases).
1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your STM.
1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the JAR file in, and use the `java -jar ip.jar` command to run the application.

    A welcome message similar to the below should appear in a few milliseconds.
    ```
    ____________________________________________________________
    Hello! I'm Skylee!
    What can I do for you?
    ____________________________________________________________
    ```

1. Type the command after the prompt `> ` and press Enter to execute it.
1. Refer to the [User Guide](https://skylee03.github.io/ip/) for details of each command.
