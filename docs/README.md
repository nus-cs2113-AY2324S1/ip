1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your STM.
1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the JAR file in, and use the `java -jar ip.jar` command to run the application.

    A welcome message similar to the below should appear in a few milliseconds.
    ```

## Features

:information_source: **Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  
  For example, in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo Add a brief User Guide`.

* Parameters cannot be in any order.
  
  For example, if the command specifies `DESCRIPTION /from START_TIME /to END_TIME`, `DESCRIPTION /to END_TIME /from START_TIME` is not acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored.
  
  For example, if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
